Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an AI Engineer and Data Engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions in **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing**. Whether it's building powerful AI models or creating data engineering pipelines or solutions, I'm always working on projects that make an impact.

I also teach Artificial Intelligence concepts through my **LinkedIn Learning** courses, sharing knowledge with a wide community of learners.

### Key Projects

1. **[Behavioral Cloning of Self Driving Car]**  
   Description: Behavioral Cloning Project for Self-Driving Car Nano Degree Term 1. The project includes designing a neural network and then training the car on the road in unity simulator. The CNN learns and clones the driving behavior.

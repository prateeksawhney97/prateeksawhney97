Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and Data Engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions in **Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing**. Whether it's building powerful AI models or creating data engineering pipelines or solutions, I'm always working on projects that make an impact.

I also teach Artificial Intelligence concepts through my **LinkedIn Learning** courses, sharing knowledge with a wide community of learners.

### Key Projects

1. **[Behavioral Cloning of Self Driving Car]**  
   Description: In this project, I designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to mimic human driving behavior using a Unity-based driving simulator. The model learns by observing and clones driving behavior, enabling a self-driving car to navigate complex roads autonomously. From data collection to real-time decision-making, this project showcases the power of AI in the future of autonomous vehicles! üöóüí°

3. **[Advance Lane Finding]**  
   Description: In this project, I implemented advanced image processing techniques to accurately detect lane lines, no matter the road texture, lighting, or curves. By using image warping and a sliding window approach, the system reliably identifies lane boundaries. Additionally, I calculated the real curvature of the lane and determined the vehicle‚Äôs position relative to the center for enhanced driving precision. üöóüîç
